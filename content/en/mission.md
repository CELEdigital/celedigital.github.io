The Center for Studies on Freedom of Expression (CELE) was created in 2009 within the Faculty of Law of the University of Palermo with the objective of providing research to journalists, government institutions, academic units, and other sectors of civil society dedicated to the defense and promotion of these rights, especially in Latin America.
